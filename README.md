### Hi, I'm Cindy Stadterman 👋
**UI Developer · Front-End Designer · Creative Technologist**

*Reviving a lifelong passion for visual design — now with code.*

I'm a UI Developer and Front-End Designer with **18+ years of professional graphic design experience**, recently graduated from the **Adobe Digital Academy Software Engineering Bootcamp** at General Assembly. My design career gave me a trained eye for typography, layout, and user experience — and the bootcamp gave me the technical skills to build what I can envision.

I love taking a basic concept and asking *"but what if it looked really good?"* — transforming simple assignments into polished, real-world mini-projects with custom branding, thoughtful UX, and professional styling.

## 🎨 My Background

I spent 18 years as a professional graphic designer before stepping away from the field in 2016. After a decade of other work, the Adobe Digital Academy Bootcamp reignited my creative side — this time with the technical skills to bring designs to life in the browser. Now I build things that work *and* look intentional — because I believe good UI isn't just a nice-to-have, it's the product.

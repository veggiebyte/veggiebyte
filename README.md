# Hi, I'm Cindy Stadterman 👋

### UI Developer · Front-End Designer · Creative Technologist

*Reviving a lifelong passion for visual design — now with code.*

I'm a UI Developer and Front-End Designer with **18+ years of professional graphic design experience**, recently graduated from the **Adobe Digital Academy Software Engineering Bootcamp** at General Assembly. I bring something most developers don't: a trained eye for design, typography, and user experience — built long before I ever wrote a line of JavaScript.

I love taking a basic assignment and asking *"but what if it looked really good?"* — transforming simple homework into polished, real-world mini-projects with custom branding, thoughtful UX, and professional styling.

## 🎨 My Background

Before code, I spent **18 years as a professional graphic designer** — working with clients on branding, print, and digital media. When I stepped away from that world, I never lost the eye for detail or the instinct for what makes something *feel* right visually.

The Adobe Digital Academy Bootcamp gave me the technical foundation to combine both worlds. Now I build things that work *and* look intentional — because I believe good UI isn't just a nice-to-have, it's the product.

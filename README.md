## 👋 About Me

I'm a UI Developer and Front-End Designer with 18 years of professional graphic design experience, recently graduated from the Adobe Digital Academy Software Engineering Bootcamp at General Assembly. I've always been drawn to the intersection of visual design and technology. Now, I build things that work and look intentional. During the bootcamp, I loved taking basic homework assignments and transforming them into polished, professional products with custom branding, thoughtful UX, and intentional styling.
